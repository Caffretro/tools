This repository contains miscellaneous scripts used primarily by the
OSG Software and Release teams.

Maintainer note:
Because UW CS cron jobs use some of these scripts, there is a clone of
this repo located at "/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/tools" on UW AFS.  After
merging or making changes to the "master" branch, don't forget to do

  cd /p/condor/workspaces/vdt/tools && git pull

so the cron jobs get the updated scripts.
